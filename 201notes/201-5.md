# HTML Media and CSS styling

## HTML
    - What is a real world use case for the alt attribute being used in a website?

    Two things. If a picture is not loading properly the user can still can some idea of what the picture contained. 

    Also if the user has no sight. I am guessing their is functionality to read out the alt of a picture to someone who would access your site. So having a detailed alt would prove beneficial to those users.

    - How can you improve accessibility of images in an HTML document?

    As spoken about above. For the visually impaired.

    - Provide an example of when the figure element would be useful in an HTML document.

    One using figure is semantic so it helps the flow of the website out and how its looked at. It lets you frame and caption things easily. So instead of just using <img> you can use <figure> and contain the img and then at a <figcaption> to it which is a general caption.

    - Describe the difference between a gif image and an svg image, pretend you are explaining to an elder in your community.

    Gif is commonly used for basic animation or clips. While the SVG is more used for formatting and UI elements.

    - What image type would you use to display a screenshot on your website and why?

    Most would use JPEG, but if you wanted more precision with your screenshot on a website you would use PNG. Also can be used for edited pictures with no background etc.

## CSS

    - Describe the difference between foreground and background colors of an HTML element, pretend you are talking to someone with no technical knowledge.

    Most commone example would be the background is the overall background color of a box. So if you had a box and the entirety was filled with the color blue. You would say the background is blue, but if you added text into the middle of that box, and colored it white. Just imagine you plop the text ontop of the background, and you have your foreground.

    - Your friend asks you to give his colorless blog website a touch up. How would you use color to give his blog some character?

    Background color. Text color that compliments the background but pops depending on what the friend wants. Editing sections, and potential tables with color both to borders and interiors.

    - What should you consider when choosing fonts for an HTML document?

    Depends if you want general readability or emphasis among other things. Some fonts could be to hard to read a large amount of text whether due to its design or how bold it is. Its better to use a more basic font for general reading, but use things with more design for emphasis points, titles, headers etc.

    - What do font-size, font-weight, and font-style do to HTML text elements?

    Size dictates the size of the text, weight determines how bold the text is in so little words, and style adds character so to speak (example italic font).

    - Describe two ways you could add spacing around the characters displayed in an h1 element.

    Spacing in an H1 element would mostly be used for legibility or if you were going for a certain look. If you did not say spacing around characters. Most people would think about positining and like borders and margins when it came to alter an H1.

## Things I want to know more about

    Still in the middle of learning CS. Last week had flex just thrown into the mix out of nowhere so just still a learning gambit that I am going through.
