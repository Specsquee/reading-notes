# CSS Flexbox. LETS GOOOO!

## CSS - Flexbox!

    - Flexbox is designed for one-dimensional content. Explain what this means.

    It is designed for one dimensional items. It gives additional style handling to produce a fluid and correct layout.

    - Explain the difference between the main axis and cross axis.

    Main axis goes left to right, while the cross axis goes up and down.

    - How can using certain properties of flexbox negatively impact accessibility?
    
    When you use properties that move things around. They change in the visual order but not the logical one. So it can mess with those that need to use tools or software to understand your content.

## CSS - Flexbox layout!

    -What are some advantages of using flexbox over float?

    In simple terms and not to sound punish you get more flexability. You get to move things around to places you exactly want them to go instead of floating them to an area and trying to make the content around it look nice.

    - How does this topic connect with your long term goals?

    In terms of design its just a very good tool for working on the layout of a website. Making something more appealing easier on the eyes for users who may stumble upon it.
