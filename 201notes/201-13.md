# Local Storage!

## Local Storage and how its used on websites!

     - Why would a developer use local storage for a web application?
     
     Saves user data for use with the website locally. So the user does not need to sign up anywhere. Also stores data that can be reused once the user comes back.

     - What information should not be stored in local storage?

     User data like inputed personal data. Passwords etc.
     
     - Local storage can store what type of data? How would you convert it to that type before storing?

     Local storage can only store strings. You can use both the JSON.stringify() and parse methods to convert the data before storing.
