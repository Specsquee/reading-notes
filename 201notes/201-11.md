# Audio, video and images!

## Video and audio content!

    - Explain how the ability to use video and audio on the web has evolved since the early 2000s.

    They have moved more inhouse with HTML elements and the ability to be controlled with Javascript. Before you had to use unsecure plugins that had risks associated with them.

    - Describe the use of the src and controls attributes in the <video> element.

    The src is the video you want to play, and the controls is adding the functionality to control the volume levels and video playback (This is especially important for those) and ability to start and stop the content.

    - Why is it important to have fallback content inside the <video> element?

    So if the video does not play on the page it is supposed to. The user has a direct link so they can potentially watch it on the source site if it works there.

    - Write a very short story where <audio> and <video> are characters.

    Both were embedded in an evil castle, and it took an brave something or other to come and give it better controls so people could use them properly. (Sorry doing this after catching up the rest of my reading. Brain is going numb.)

## Grid!

    - How does Grid layout differ from Flex?

    While flex is designed for one-dimensional content. CSS Grid uses a two-dimenional grid system.

    - Grid container, grid item, and grid line are a few important terms to understand when using Grid. Please describe these terms in a few sentences. 

    Grid container: The element that grid is applied to. It is the parent to all your grid inside.

    Grid Item: The children of the container. So what is contained in side.

    Grid Line: Lines you place on the grid that can either be verticle or horizontal. These are what will be used to create a your grid. Depending on the placement and properties you will create a sections appropriate for your design.

## Responsive images!

    - Besides making a site visually appealing across different screen sizes, why should developers make images responsive?

    It can waste bandwidth instead of picking something optimal it is picking some unoptimal to show on a screen not suited to an image size. You can have multiple resolutions for the browser to choose from. Or from allowing you to change the resolution of said image. Gives options to give the users the best experience. 

    - Define the following <img> attributes srcset and sizes. Write an example of how they are used.

    srcset - Defines the images that the browswer can choose from, and the size of each of them.

    sizes - Defines the conditions that upon true or false would choose from the srcset on whatever device you are on.

    So srcset has the objects, and the conditions in sizes chooses which one to push onto the screen.

    - How is srcset more helpful for responsive images than CSS or JavaScript?

    The images will download at the start of you opening a page. As opposed to once the browser started going through CSS and JS. It also messes with some functionality of responsive images.

## Things I want to know more about!

    - Looking forward to learning this in lecture and trying it out. Both grid and responsive images.
