# Growth Mindset 102-1

### **1. How I view growth mindset.**

To me growth mindset is not something easily attained. It is something that life can beat out of you before you really have a chance to grow and nuture it. Instead of seeing things as hopeless you can start wraping your head around a problem and how to move past it efficiently. To understand that not all problems have a solution that can be readily seen and it can be overcom as long as you take the time to stop and think, and not give into the notion something cannot be done or accomplished.

### **2. Examples of how I remind myself to stay in a growth mindset.**

- When I find myself at a wall that seems to scale up into the sky and is a wide as far as my eyes can see. Taking a breath and just reaffirming that it can still be climbed. It can still be side stepped, and with enough effort I can smash right through it.

- When my mind starts to believe something cannot be done. Take a step back and try and view the problem through a different light. Try attacking it from different angles instead of giving up.

- Just simply reminding myself that nothing is impossible, and its human to try quantify something as such and to give up, but at the same time knowing that that is not the case and nothing is impossible.
