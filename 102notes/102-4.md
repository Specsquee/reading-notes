# Structure with HTML

So as I right this with Markdown. The next step when it comes to creating websites would be HTML. While I love Markdown for its clean simplicity and how easy it flows. HTML is essentially one of the tools you can use to create a solid foundation for a house so to speak. It does not have anything really fancy, but the foundation is rock solid and it can be easilly maniplated and changed based on whoever is using it. The reason for this is with the edition of external tools and how they are able to latch itself onto the HTML tags. It gives you more manipulation.



    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>

    <body>

    <head>
    <title>Insert Title</title>
    </head)>

    <header>
    <h1>This is a website</h1>
    </header>

    <main>
    <p>paragraphs of text</p>
    <img src="insert link or location here" alt="picture">
    </main>

    <footer>
    Insert copyright jargon here!
    </footer>

    </body>

    </html>


That right there with a few lines of words. Nothing all that hard to rememeber is the start of a website. It might look like a lot, but its not. Its very simple to remember.

## Things I want to know more about

Not to cop out. I am still touching the surface of the systems that are being placed in front of me. Just using the bare bones to hopefully start a foundation of development. I just want time and the questions will come with that the more I understand HTML.
