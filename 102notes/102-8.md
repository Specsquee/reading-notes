# Operators and Loops!

Its hard to really quantify how I feel after the entirety today, but more so in class eight. My brain is beyond fried. I am not one to not admit when I have failed and my mind was blank today. My eyes were on the screen reading. My ears were listening to the lecture, but what should have a quick lab of adding (what I know can be easy) two loops to my website. A while loop and a for loop.

Here is what I ended up with.

    while(funAnswer == ""){
    funAnswer = prompt("Are you here to grade my Javascript? YES or NO I WILL NOT ASK AGAIN! (I will)");

This first one I had already built the structure for, and I simply had to add while to it, but this one I had a brain fart and missed it entirely. The amount of things I deleted and tried gave me a headache.

The second loop is the for loop and it was for adding pictures to the website upon request.

     let gum = prompt ("How many pieces of gum do you swallow between 1 and 3?")
     for (let i = 0; i < gum; i++){
     document.write("<img src='gumwall.jpg' alt='gross wall' />");
     if(i == 2){
        break;

This one was a lot easier as I had my notes and was able to get the proper structure for it. Just took time to first get the right wording for the pictures to show up, and second with a TA's help I was able to cap the amount of pictures per input to coincide with the question of 1 and 3.

## Things I want to know more about

Overall though I need to sit down and practice this and the week between 102 and 201 this will be one of my focus's. I need to get Javascript into my headspace to understand it better. Its fun to learn but information overload.
