## My new experiences with Linux!

This one is tricky for me. Really today was my first experience with Linux or really how the commands flow and how it functions. At face value though what I will say off the bat is I like the idea of the utility to move quickly and efficiently through folders and files you may commonly use. While I certainly am not at a level where I am not second guessing what I am typing just yet. As with Markdown I am excited to beging using another language completely foreign to me. It is very interesting to have commands such as **pwd** and **ls** to constantly update yourself on your location and its content. In general just how information is presented will take time to get used to but I thankfully understand and can place myself where I am and identify what is in that location.

## Things I want to know more about

As of this point I just want to be learn more, and find out the general utility range Linux has with software development. As with Markdown I got the rough idea, but I need to actually just use Linux to get muscle memory for navigating it. So excited for the rest of this week to practice and start building a real foundation.
